# This repository contains solution for the famous mnist dataset on kaggle.</br>
* It contains a .ipynb containing all the steps involved in training the model. You can go through the file and tweak it to generate a submission file for the kaggle problem.<br/>
* The .ipynb also generates a onnx file which will be used by our application.</br>
* To run the application just run "python game.py". A window will popup, now you need to draw a number from 0-9 using your mouse and it will predict which number you drew.</br>
